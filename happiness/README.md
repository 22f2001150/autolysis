# Happiness Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the Happiness dataset. The project includes generating a heatmap based on correlations within the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The `happiness.csv` dataset contains information on various countries and their happiness scores, along with factors like GDP per capita, social support, and life expectancy. The analysis focuses on visualizing relationships and correlations between the features in the dataset.

## Steps

1. The dataset `happiness.csv` is loaded and cleaned to remove missing or irrelevant data.
2. A correlation heatmap is generated to visualize relationships between the features in the dataset.
3. The heatmap image is saved as `happiness.png`.

## Files

- `autolysis.py`: The script that processes the dataset and generates the heatmap.
- `happiness.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `happiness.png`: The heatmap image generated based on the dataset.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you can execute the `autolysis.py` script:

```bash
python autolysis.py /path/to/happiness.csv
