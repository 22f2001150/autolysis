# Media Dataset Analysis

This repository contains the analysis of the Media dataset. The project includes generating a heatmap based on correlations within the dataset.

## Dataset Description

The `media.csv` dataset contains various attributes related to media consumption, including demographics, media type, and time spent. The analysis focuses on visualizing relationships and correlations between the dataset features.

## Steps

1. The dataset `media.csv` is loaded and cleaned to remove missing or irrelevant data.
2. A correlation heatmap is generated to visualize relationships between the features in the dataset.
3. The heatmap image is saved as `media.png`.

## Files

- `autolysis.py`: The script that processes the dataset and generates the heatmap.
- `media.csv`: The dataset used for the analysis.
- `media.png`: The heatmap image generated based on the dataset.

## Usage

To run the analysis, you can execute the `autolysis.py` script:

```bash
python autolysis.py /path/to/media.csv
